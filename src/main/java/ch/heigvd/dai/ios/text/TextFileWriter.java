    Personal note after trying to understand what this write() does:
    What we are writing depends on the charset chosen!
    UTF-8 is capable of encoding all 1,112,064[2] valid Unicode code points using a variable-width
    encoding of one to four one-byte (8-bit) code units (ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8).
    This means that when writing ints, these would be encoded as characters in UTF-8 and they would
    occupy a variable size. Consequently, when asking for 1024 bytes we would end with a file with
    around 1.8 KB.
    To solve this we need to either cast the int to a byte before writing while only doing half ot
    the iterations or simply use the US_ASCII encoding.
